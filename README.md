# License-Plate-Detection
This is a project which crops out the license plate from an image and then uses pytesseract to convert the text from the resultant image to a string. 
It involves a lot of image processing tasks such as converting to gray scale, smoothening an image, finding the right contours and then finally extracting the license plate. 
The sample image is the image I used as input to this model and the result image is what I got as an output.
